#' datastructures
#'
#' Implementation of advanced data structures such as hashmaps,
#' heaps, or queues. Advanced data structures are essential
#' in many computer science and statistics problems, for example graph
#' algorithms or string analysis. The package uses 'Boost' and 'STL' data
#' types and extends these to R with 'Rcpp' modules.
