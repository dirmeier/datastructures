\description{
Implementation of advanced data structures such as hashmaps,
heaps, or queues. Advanced data structures are essential
in many computer science and statistics problems, for example graph
algorithms or string analysis. The package uses 'Boost' and 'STL' data
types and extends these to R with 'Rcpp' modules.
